🔒 TrustVault Smart Contracts

Proof of Original Work — Secured on-chain
Part of the TrustVault ecosystem — an AI-powered originality and fingerprinting platform.

⸻

🧭 Overview

TrustVault Contracts form the on-chain backbone of the TrustVault ecosystem.
They provide a decentralized verification layer that immutably stores and verifies digital fingerprints generated by the AI Fingerprint Agent.

Every uploaded file or text on the frontend is transformed into a unique vector hash, and this hash is registered on-chain as proof of originality.

⚙️ Core Concept

TrustVault bridges AI fingerprinting and blockchain proof.
	1.	🧠 The AI Agent computes a vector fingerprint for a given asset.
	2.	🔐 This fingerprint hash, along with metadata (owner address, timestamp, and proof ID), is sent to the TrustVault smart contract.
	3.	⛓️ The contract stores it immutably on-chain, allowing anyone to verify authenticity later.


  🛠️ Smart Contract Features

🧾 1. Register Proof

function registerProof(bytes32 fingerprint, string memory metadata) external returns (uint256 proofId);

•	Records a fingerprint hash with associated metadata.
•	Emits ProofRegistered event for off-chain indexing.

🔍 2. Verify Proof
function verifyProof(bytes32 fingerprint) external view returns (bool exists, address owner, uint256 timestamp);

•	Checks if a fingerprint exists and returns its metadata.
•	Enables instant originality verification.

🪪 3. Ownership Control
	•	Each proof is tied to the wallet address of its creator.
	•	Ownership cannot be transferred — ensuring permanent attribution.

🧩 4. Events
event ProofRegistered(address indexed owner, bytes32 fingerprint, uint256 timestamp);
event ProofVerified(address indexed verifier, bytes32 fingerprint, bool valid);
