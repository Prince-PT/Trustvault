🤖 TrustVault AI Fingerprint Agent

This agent generates an AI-based semantic fingerprint for any text or document.
It encodes input using the MiniLM model, normalizes it, and produces a SHA-256 hash — a unique vector signature representing meaning, not just words.

⸻

🧠 Example Input

text = "Education fosters creativity and innovation for global progress."

🧾 Example Output

vector_hash = "e3f89a06b5c1eb214c5ad..."
embedding_preview = [0.173, -0.034, 0.095, 0.041, -0.012]


⸻

💬 Usage Example

from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

class FingerprintRequest(Model):
    text: str

class FingerprintResponse(Model):
    vector_hash: str
    embedding_preview: list

AGENT = "agent1qwtd28wxmuvyl5xr749k9u3cswhr9kh6p6xd3jtl8ald4wslxhkpzmwv5mv"

@Agent().on_event("startup")
async def start(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(AGENT, FingerprintRequest(text="Sample text"))

Would you like me to make a Markdown-styled banner (like a bold title section with badges for “AI”, “TrustVault”, “Semantic Fingerprinting”, etc.) that you can paste at the top of your AgentVerse listing or GitHub page? It makes your agent look professional and discoverable.
